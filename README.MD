# Big data : Hexagone M2 IA

## Project description

1. Build a performing Machine Learning model to predict oneâ€™s income level. Details should be paid on how to measure and challenge this model performance, and if needed how to improve it. 
2. Deploy the model as an API service, that you can then integrate within the infrastructure you learned to build along this course.
